What can a 250 year old merchantâ€™s ledger tell us about consumer
purchases? This site hopes to make a dusty ledger more familiar and
fun by presenting the book's historical evidence as it might be
encountered in a modern on-line store. The user can read about what
they are shopping for, see what similar items might look like, examine
a range of options, and see a modern cost comparison. They can also
see some of the range of other items purchased by a customer. Future
features will include more information on customers and more complex
diagnostic analysis of purchases.

About this repository
=====================

This is the code used to generate the Ramsay interactive
"e-commerce"-like ledger website.  It evolved initially from a dynamic
site to a static site, so this project includes a Python web
application written in Flask, along with a static exporter which
generates the static site from a running version of the dynamic site.

The "database" generating the site contents is a simple CSV file
included in this repository, `LedgerDB.csv`.
